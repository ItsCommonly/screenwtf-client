# Screen.wtf
This is a screenshot client create to make use of the domain Screen.wtf, I thought I'd add it to github for public usage.

The code isn't great, but when you have code this minimal it doesn't really require much else.

I've made use of the system default screenshotting tools on operating systems:
* Windows: `snipping-tool /clip`
* Linux: `gnome-screenshot -ac`
* MacOS/Darwin: `screencapture -ic`

Hopefully this can serve as an example of some form!
